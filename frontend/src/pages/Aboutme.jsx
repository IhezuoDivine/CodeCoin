        <p className="aboutp">
          <span className="aboutspan">Origin Story </span>Code Coin was born out
          of pure digital creativity a meme for the builders, dreamers, and
          jokers of the internet age. It wasn't made to chase charts. It was
          made for the culture to bring laughter, innovation, and unity back to
          crypto. While others talk about utility, we talk about community and
          the power of memes to move markets, minds, and movements. Code Coin
          exists to remind the crypto world that the best projects often start
          with a joke… and end up changing the game.

        <p className="aboutp">
          Our mascot a cheeky digital fox wearing coder glasses symbolizes:
          Curiosity always learning, always exploring. Cleverness because memes
          are smarter than you think. Code & Chaos representing the balance
          between building and having fun. The fox stands for adaptability just
          like our community, ready to pivot, code, and meme through every
          market season.

        <h2 className="abouth2">100% Community-Driven</h2>
        <p className="aboutp">
          No dev taxes. No greedy wallets. No hidden tricks. Every coin, every
          meme, every milestone belongs to the people. Code Coin runs on
          transparency, humor, and collective power. We believe the strongest
          ecosystems are those built by the community, for the community no
          middlemen, no gatekeepers, no whales calling the shots. This isn't a
          project where the devs get rich it's a movement where the community
          wins together.
